FAQ

**How do I connect?**

Java Players : minecraft.gabsolution.ca (port is 25565 its default)
Bedrock players: minecraft.gabsolution.ca (port is 19132, its also default for bedrock)

**Things dont seem to look the same to me as a bedrock player?**

Java players see the custom texture so they get a compass to teleport home, bedrock players will see a paper, either way that item will take you back to spawn when used either left or right clicked!

**I can not build anything, or break any bricks?**

Yes there is a safe zone around the spawn area that will prevent any kind of building or breaking, to preserve the area. Just move a little out of town and you should be good to go!

**Is this Vanilla Minecraft?**

Short answer : Yes!
Not as short answer: Not entirely, this server is based on "paperMC" which allows for plugin support. Gabu is working tirelessly to implement new and exciting features.
Currently we have a few plugins installed, and we are looking for more that would add to the experience.

** RPG elements?**

There is a plan to implement mob dropped keys, to open loot chests. These chests will carry powerful gear and items. *wip*
